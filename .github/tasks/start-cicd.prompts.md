2. **Decision Gate**: Presents 3 CI/CD phase options with requirements
3. User selects appropriate phase
4. Creates CI/CD roadmap

**Deliverables**:
- Project maturity assessment
- CI/CD phase recommendation
- Implementation roadmap

**Decision Gates**:
- ✋ **Gate 0.1**: CI/CD phase selection (USER DECIDES complexity level)

**Example Output**:
```
CI/CD Phase Assessment for TaskMaster Pro

Project Analysis:
├─ Codebase: 15 user stories implemented (5,000 LOC)
├─ Test Coverage: 87% (good)
├─ Team Size: 4 developers
├─ Stage: MVP nearing completion
├─ Deployment History: None yet (first deployment pending)
└─ Infrastructure: AWS selected, no IaC yet

Recommendation: Start with Phase 1 (Bootstrap), plan Phase 2 in 4-6 weeks

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🎯 DECISION GATE: Select CI/CD Phase
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Phase 1: Bootstrap (RECOMMENDED for your project)**

├─ Automation: Build, unit tests, basic code quality, dev environment
├─ Deployment: Manual staging, automatic dev environment
├─ Quality Gates: Build passes, no critical vulnerabilities, basic coverage
├─ Monitoring: Error logs, basic health checks
├─ Timeline: 2-3 days setup
├─ Pros: Fast setup, low complexity, good for MVP/early stage
└─ Cons: Limited automation, manual staging deployment, basic monitoring

**Phase 2: Stabilization**
├─ Infrastructure: Kubernetes, staging environment, artifact registry
├─ Automation: Integration tests, API tests, automated BDD, canary deployment
├─ Deployment: Automated staging, canary to production (10% → 50% → 100%)
├─ Quality Gates: All tests pass, coverage maintained, performance baseline
├─ Monitoring: APM, log aggregation, performance metrics
├─ Timeline: 1-2 weeks setup
├─ Pros: Production-grade automation, safer deployments, good observability
└─ Cons: Higher complexity, requires DevOps expertise, infrastructure cost

**Phase 3: Optimization**
├─ Infrastructure: Full IaC (Terraform), blue-green deployment, secrets vault
├─ Automation: Mutation testing, DAST, chaos engineering, load testing
├─ Deployment: Zero-downtime blue-green, automated rollback, feature flags
├─ Quality Gates: Mutation score >80%, load test pass, chaos test resilience
├─ Monitoring: Full observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, distributed tracing)
├─ Timeline: 2-3 weeks setup
├─ Pros: Enterprise-grade, highest quality, maximum reliability
└─ Cons: High complexity, expensive infrastructure, requires dedicated DevOps

Ready for Production? Not yet - recommend Phase 2 (Stabilization) for production deployment

Next Steps:
1. Continue development with auto-deploying dev environment
2. Plan Phase 2 (Stabilization) in 4-6 weeks when approaching production
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance and adjust quality gates

Would you like to:
[A] Start Phase 2 now (add staging environment + production deployment)
[B] Continue with Phase 1 and revisit Phase 2 later
[C] Review Phase 1 configuration and adjust
```

5. **APM Monitoring**: Application Performance Monitoring (New Relic / Datadog)
6. **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging (ELK / Splunk)

---

## Phase 3: Optimization Setup (2-3 Weeks)

### Prerequisites for Phase 3:
- Phase 2 complete and stable
- High-traffic production environment
- Dedicated DevOps resources
- Budget for advanced infrastructure

5. **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience testing in production
6. **Full Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, distributed tracing

---

## Quick Start Commands

**Assess CI/CD Phase:**
```
@orchestrator Assess CI/CD maturity and recommend phase for [PROJECT_NAME]
```

**Setup Specific Phase:**
```
@orchestrator Setup CI/CD Phase [1/2/3] for [PROJECT_NAME]
```

**Upgrade CI/CD Phase:**
```
@orchestrator Upgrade from Phase [X] to Phase [Y]
```

**Check CI/CD Status:**
```
@orchestrator Show CI/CD pipeline status and health
```

**Troubleshoot Pipeline:**
```
@orchestrator Troubleshoot failing CI/CD pipeline
```

---

## Key CI/CD Principles

1. **Phased Evolution**: Start simple (Phase 1), evolve to complex (Phase 2/3) as project matures
2. **Quality Gates**: Enforce appropriate quality standards for project phase
3. **Automation First**: Automate testing before automating deployment
4. **Fast Feedback**: Keep CI pipeline under 10 minutes
5. **Rollback Ready**: Always have rollback capability before production deployment
6. **Monitoring Essential**: Can't improve what you don't measure
7. **Documentation**: Keep runbooks updated with every change
8. **Security Scanning**: Check dependencies and code for vulnerabilities
9. **Incremental Deployment**: Canary/blue-green for production safety
10. **Cost Awareness**: Balance automation sophistication with infrastructure cost

## Common Decision Gates

### Gate 1: Initial Phase Selection
- Consider: project maturity, team size, budget, deployment urgency
- Options: Bootstrap (fast, simple) vs Stabilization (production-ready) vs Optimization (enterprise)

### Gate 2: Deployment Strategy
- Consider: traffic volume, downtime tolerance, rollback requirements
- Options: Rolling (simple) vs Canary (gradual) vs Blue-Green (zero-downtime)

### Gate 3: Monitoring Level
- Consider: error budget, SLA requirements, team capacity
- Options: Basic health (logs) vs APM (metrics) vs Full observability (traces)

### Gate 4: Infrastructure Approach
- Consider: team DevOps skills, budget, scalability needs
- Options: Managed services (simple) vs Kubernetes (flexible) vs IaC (reproducible)

1. **Build Success Rate**: % of successful builds (target: >95%)
2. **Build Duration**: Time from commit to pipeline complete (target: <10 minutes)
3. **Deployment Frequency**: Deployments per day/week (target: increases over time)
4. **Deployment Success Rate**: % of successful deployments (target: >98%)
5. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to fix production issues (target: <30 minutes)
6. **Test Coverage**: % of code covered by tests (target: >80%)
7. **Security Vulnerability Response**: Time to patch critical vulnerabilities (target: <24 hours)
