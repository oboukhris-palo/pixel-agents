# Code Review Standards

## Review Purpose
Ensure code quality, maintainability, security, and compliance with project standards before merging.

---

## 13-Point Code Review Checklist

### 1. Requirements Compliance ✅
- [ ] Code implements all acceptance criteria from user story
- [ ] BDD scenarios pass (green tests)
- [ ] No scope creep (only implements story requirements)

### 2. SOLID Principles 🏗️
- [ ] **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class/function has one reason to change
- [ ] **O**pen/Closed: Extensible without modification (use interfaces/abstractions)
- [ ] **L**iskov Substitution: Subclasses work as base class replacements
- [ ] **I**nterface Segregation: No fat interfaces (clients use all methods)
- [ ] **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. No Code Duplication ♻️
- [ ] No copy-pasted code (extract to shared functions/classes)
- [ ] DRY principle: Logic exists in one place only
- [ ] Shared utilities properly abstracted

### 4. Clear Naming 📝
- [ ] Variables/functions/classes have descriptive names
- [ ] Naming reveals intent (no `temp`, `data`, `foo`)
- [ ] Boolean variables are questions (`isActive`, `hasPermission`)
- [ ] Functions are verbs (`getUserById`, `validateEmail`)

### 5. Test Coverage 🧪
- [ ] Tests cover happy paths (expected inputs → expected outputs)
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases (boundaries, empty, null)
- [ ] Tests cover error paths (exceptions, validation failures)
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%, integration coverage >70%

### 6. Input Validation 🛡️
- [ ] All user inputs validated (type, format, length, range)
- [ ] Validation happens at API boundaries (not deep in business logic)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Validation rules documented in code comments

### 7. No Hardcoded Secrets 🔐  
- [ ] No API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- [ ] Secrets stored in environment variables or secret management system
- [ ] .env files in .gitignore
- [ ] Configuration separate from code

### 8. No Performance Issues ⚡
- [ ] No obvious O(n²) algorithms where O(n) or O(log n) possible
- [ ] Database queries optimized (indexes, pagination, no N+1)
- [ ] No unnecessary network calls in loops
- [ ] Caching used where appropriate

### 9. Self-Documenting Code 📖
- [ ] Code logic is clear without needing extensive comments
- [ ] WHY comments present for non-obvious decisions
- [ ] API documentation (JSDoc/docstrings) for public functions
- [ ] Complex algorithms explained

### 10. Appropriate Design Patterns 🎨
- [ ] Design patterns used correctly (not over-engineered)
- [ ] Patterns fit the problem (Repository, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- [ ] No anti-patterns (God Object, Spaghetti Code, etc.)

### 11. Architecture Consistency 🏛️
- [ ] Follows project layering (Database → Backend → Config → Frontend)
- [ ] Respects boundaries (no direct DB access from frontend)
- [ ] Dependency injection used correctly
- [ ] Follows established patterns in codebase

### 12. No Dead Code 🧹
- [ ] No unused imports, variables, functions
- [ ] No commented-out code (use version control history)
- [ ] No unreachable code paths

### 13. No Magic Numbers/Strings 🔮
- [ ] Hard-coded values extracted to named constants
- [ ] Constants explained (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3 // Security policy`)
- [ ] Configuration values in config files (not scattered in code)

## Severity Classification

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Block merge)
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass)
- Data loss scenarios (unvalidated deletes, cascade issues)
- Breaking changes without migration path
- Failing tests or BDD scenarios
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials

**Action**: MUST fix before merge

### 🟠 HIGH (Should fix before merge)
- Performance issues (inefficient algorithms, N+1 queries)
- Missing error handling (unhandled exceptions)
- Incomplete test coverage (<70%)
- SOLID principle violations
- Missing input validation

**Action**: Fix before merge OR create follow-up story with justification

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Consider fixing)
- Code duplication (small sections)
- Minor code smells (long functions, deep nesting)
- Missing inline comments for complex logic
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Opportunities for refactoring

**Action**: Fix if time permits OR add TODO comment

### 🟢 LOW (Optional improvements)
- Style preferences (not covered by linter)
- Micro-optimizations without measured benefit
- Alternative patterns (both are acceptable)
- Documentation enhancements

**Action**: Optional; discuss with team

## Review Focus by Layer

### Layer 1 (Database) 🗄️
- **Migration Safety**: Reversible migrations, data preservation, no destructive changes
- **Index Performance**: Indexes on foreign keys and query columns
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints, cascades, uniqueness
- **Schema Design**: Normalization, appropriate data types, default values

### Layer 2 (Backend) 🔧
- **Business Logic Correctness**: Implements domain rules accurately
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks, meaningful errors, logging
- **Transaction Management**: ACID properties, rollback on failure
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation from controllers/routes

### Layer 3 (Config) ⚙️
- **DI Correctness**: Dependencies properly injected, lifecycle management
- **Feature Flag Safety**: Default states, gradual rollout, kill switches
- **Route Security**: Auth middleware, rate limiting, CORS
- **Environment Config**: No hardcoded values, env-specific settings

### Layer 4 (Frontend) 🎨
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **State Management**: Redux/Context correctness, no prop drilling
- **Component Structure**: Reusable components, proper composition
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error messages, responsive design
